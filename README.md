# Trumpet 3D

This is my attempt at creating a 3d object in a 2d space (the terminal), based on the math used for
[donut.c by Andy Sloane](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).
Instead of recreating a donut, my goal is to use Torricelli's Trumpet since it is a different 3D surface,
which should generalize my understanding of 3d projection and matrix transformations by making me think about
a different surface without a preexisting example.
